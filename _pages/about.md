I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at [the Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability](https://salatainstitute.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University, jointly appointed to the [Environmental and Natural Resource Program](https://www.belfercenter.org/programs/environment-and-natural-resources) at the Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. My research focuses on environmental and agricultural economics, particularly evaluating the effectiveness of existing market-based and regulatory approaches for addressing climate change and environmental pollution across diverse institutional contexts, with the goal of informing future policy design.

I am on the academic job market for 2025-26.

I received my Ph.D. from the [Institute of Data, Systems, and Society](https://idss.mit.edu/) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2022, where my dissertation examined how misaligned incentives and information gaps undermine effective environmental governance in China. Following this, I spent 10 months as a postdoctoral associate in the [Engineering and Public Policy](https://epp.engineering.cmu.edu//) department at Carnegie Mellon University. In collaboration with Tsinghua University and Apple, I studied the effectiveness of green electricity certificates in expanding voluntary renewable energy markets and analyzed how green electricity trading systems influence multinational corporations' investment in clean energy.
