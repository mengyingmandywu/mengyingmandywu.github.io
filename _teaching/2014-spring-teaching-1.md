In weekly recitation sections of 10–15 students, I combined economic theory
with practical policy debates and emphasized connecting theoretical models to measurable, empirical
outcomes—skills essential for studying and teaching economics. I also played a key role
in designing grading rubrics, evaluating assignments, and mentoring students through research
projects, where I emphasized clear problem formulation, evidence-based argumentation, and the
application of quantitative analysis.

Below is a selection of unedited student reviews. Full teaching evaluations are available <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RN_za6dZvdh5mK6fwtTuip3-JPSs9rma/view?usp=sharing" style="color: #A51C30; text-decoration: none;">here</a>.

• <span style="font-size: 0.9em;">*"Mengying Wu was by far the best TA I've ever had in the entire 32 college courses I've taken across three universities (Columbia University, Hunter, and MIT). She always encouraged participation, thoughtfully answered students' questions, showed clear enthusiasm for the material, and actively engaged our recitation section. She encouraged us to think deeply about the material and was a truly outstanding TA."*</span>

• <span style="font-size: 0.9em;">*"Mandy (my TA) was very helpful in answering any questions I had and leading informative recitations."*</span>

• <span style="font-size: 0.9em;">*"Mandy's recitations were the honest, open-minded, and judgment-free zone to explore the confusing material of this class, and I deeply appreciated that. In particular, it really seemed like she sympathized with our moments of confusion when it came to certain topics, which helped us to see the material for what it was: inherently abstract at times."*</span>

I earned the Kaufman Teaching Certificate from MIT, where I received formal training in evidence-based teaching practices, inclusive pedagogy, and effective course design. Guided by these principles, I developed the curriculum for <em>Data Science for Decision Making in Public Policy</em>.

• <span style="font-size: 0.9em;">*This course introduces computational tools and their application to real-world economic and policy data. The course covers supervised learning (classification and regression), unsupervised learning (clustering, text analysis), and network analysis, with each unit combining economic theory with hands-on programming exercises.
