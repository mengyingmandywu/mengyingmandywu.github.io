excerpt: 'In this study, I investigate credible and cost-effective options for sourcing green power within supply chains in China, using a mixed-methods approach. I conduct in-depth interviews with key stakeholders, including corporate sustainability leaders and energy market experts, to identify practical barriers to green power procurement, such as costs, certification hurdles, and concerns about credibility. To contextualize these challenges, I undertake a comparative case analysis with established U.S. frameworks, focusing on California''s cap-and-trade system and renewable electricity certificate markets. By integrating qualitative insights from stakeholder perspectives with institutional comparisons, I highlight structural differences, policy designs, and incentive mechanisms between China and the United States. Based on these methods, I offer evidence-based recommendations for policymakers and firms, emphasizing the importance of robust accounting standards, transparent certification, and the adaptation of international best practices to enhance the effectiveness and trustworthiness of green power sourcing in China''s supply chains.'
