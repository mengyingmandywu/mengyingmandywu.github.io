excerpt: 'We investigate the determinants of citizen engagement in bottom-up environmental monitoring using a unique dataset of citizen complaints and administrative records from prefecture-level cities in China. We employ logistic regression models to estimate the effects of prior contact with local bureaucrats and city and plant characteristics on subsequent citizen participation. There are three main findings. First, cities with lower baseline environmental performance experience significantly higher per capita complaint rates during inspections. Second, while overall complaint volume is higher in these cities, citizen reports do not reliably target the most polluting plants, underscoring the technical complexity of environmental monitoring. Third, using a natural experiment with two inspection rounds, we find that citizen complaint rates in the follow-up round decline when air pollution measures revert to baseline, suggesting that the persistence of official intervention is necessary to sustain citizen engagement. Our results imply that without additional training or resources to enhance citizen reporting accuracy, bottom-up monitoring programs may have limited effectiveness in identifying non-compliance.'
